# Test task from Portaone
## The task is to find the following four/six values:
1. the maximum number in the file;
2. the minimum number in the file;
3. the median;
4. average arithmetic value;
5. the largest (consecutive) sequence of numbers that increases (optional)
6. the largest (consecutive) sequence of numbers that is decreasing (optional)

* The proposed solution method should find all four/six values ​​from the file in no more than 90 seconds. This condition is optional, but it will be a significant plus if your solution satisfies it.

## Additional Information:
- Median: if the set of numbers has an even number of elements, then half the sum of two adjacent values ​​must be used to determine the median. That is, for example, in the set {1, 8, 14, 19}, the median will be 11 (because 0.5*(8+14)=11).

- Sequence of numbers is the order of numbers in a file that follows one another. It is possible that randomly generated data sets can have quite long complications. For example, an ascending sequence might look like this: -4390, -503, 3, 16, 5032

You are practically not limited in the choice of method and way of solving the problem. You may use any means, methods, approaches (except for the two limitations below). You can write the program in any programming language you know, or you can use existing programs/utilities. Of course, you can use ready-made sets of statistical classes/functions/libraries, but this is not the best option.

There are only the following restrictions that should be met when choosing a way to solve the problem:
- Limitation 1:
  - Any person should be able to just by your method. This means, for example, if you used your own program to solve a task, then any other person should be able to compile/run it, etc.; if you used third-party programs/utilities, any person should be able to install and use them as well; anyone can also take a completely different file with a different set of integers and find all four quantities found);
- Limitation #2:
  - when solving the problem, you cannot use illegal software (proprietary software that has been hacked, pirated copies of software, etc.). Also, if you borrowed a solution idea, software, or original sources (or some part of them) from a friend/colleague/on the Internet/wherever, please mention the source.
